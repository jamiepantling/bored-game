## Introduction

*Bored? Game!* is a web app to help you work out what board game to play. 

Log in with your google account and check the games in the database for what that suits your mood. Search by theme, or just browse them all.

Or add your favourite game to the database to recommend it to other users! The app will add a picture automatically - you can let the app add a description automatically too, or add your own.
